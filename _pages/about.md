I am a PhD student at the [Munich Institute of Robotics and Machine Intelligence (MIRMI)](https://www.mirmi.tum.de/en/mirmi/home/) at the Technical University of Munich (TUM) under the supervision of [Prof. Markus Ryll](http://markusryll.com/?q=node/4). Since January 2024, I am located at the [Robotics Institute (RI)](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/) at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), advised by [Prof. Zachary Manchester](http://zacmanchester.com/).

Before pursuing my doctoral studies, I obtained my MSc. degree in Robotics-Mechatronics at [KTH Royal Institute of Technology](https://www.kth.se/en) (Sweden, 2020) and wrote the MSc. Thesis at the robotics department of [Bosch Research](https://www.bosch-ai.com/) (Germany, 2020).

My research interests lie at the intersection of system dynamics, control theory, numerical optimization, and machine learning, with a special focus on their applications to robotic and autonomous systems. More specifically, aiming to enhance the agility, efficiency, and robustness of such systems, I develop novel methods that unify perception, planning, and control in a transparent and understandable manner. For further details, check out my [publications](#papers-section)!

You can find more about me in an [interview](assets/pdf/NavigatorWS2324.pdf#page=18) with undergrad students! If you find my work appealing or would like to [connect](mailto:jarrizab@andrew.cmu.edu), please get in touch. I am always looking for new collaborations.
